## Development Guidelines

When contributing code to Lara Dashboard, please follow these guidelines:

### Architectural Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - View/controller logic should be separated in most cases
   - Business logic should reside in Service classes
   - Controllers should be thin and primarily handle HTTP requests and responses

2. **Validation**
   - All request validation should be in dedicated classes in `Http/Requests/` directory
   - Never validate directly in controllers

3. **Internationalization (i18n)**
   - All user-facing strings should use Laravel's translation functions (`__()` or `@lang()`)
   - New strings should be added to the appropriate translation files

4. **Responsive Design**
   - All UI components must be responsive and work on mobile devices
   - Test your changes on multiple screen sizes before submitting

5. **Theme Support**
   - Ensure all UI changes work in both light and dark modes
   - Use Tailwind's dark mode variants where appropriate

6. **Authorization**
   - All actions should be properly secured with appropriate permissions
   - Use our permission system consistently throughout the code

7. **Extensibility**
   - If implementing functionality that might be useful for extension, create action/filter hooks
   - Use the Hook facade to apply filters and actions.
   - Example usage:
```php
<?php
use App\Enums\Hooks\CommonFilterHook;
use App\Enums\Hooks\UserActionHook;
use App\Enums\Hooks\UserFilterHook;
use App\Support\Facades\Hook;

// Applying a filter.
$content = Hook::applyFilters('filter_hook_name', $content);

// Adding an action.
Hook::doAction('action_hook_name', $param1, $param2);

// We've also listed all filter/action hooks inside of `app/Enums/Hooks` directory.
$content = Hook::applyFilters(UserFilterHook::USER_AFTER_BREADCRUMBS, $content);

// Adding an action via enum.
Hook::doAction(UserActionHook::USER_CREATED, $user);
```

### Coding Standards

1. **PHP Code Style**
   - Follow PSR-12 coding standards
   - Use type hints for parameters and return types
   - Use strict typing where possible
   - Document classes and methods with PHPDoc comments

2. **JavaScript and CSS**
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Use ES6 features when appropriate
   - Prefer Tailwind classes over custom CSS

3. **Naming Conventions**
   - Controllers: Singular, PascalCase (e.g., `UserController`)
   - Models: Singular, PascalCase (e.g., `User`)
   - Services: Singular with Service suffix, PascalCase (e.g., `UserService`)
   - Database: Use snake_case for tables and columns

4. **File Organization**
   - Keep files in their appropriate directories
   - Follow Laravel's directory structure conventions
   - Module-specific code should go in the appropriate module directory

### Testing

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write tests for new features and bug fixes
   - Ensure all tests pass before submitting your PR
   - Aim for a high test coverage

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Test your changes in both light and dark modes
   - Test on different screen sizes
   - Verify authorization works correctly

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. Ensure the test suite passes
4. Make sure your code follows the coding standards
5. Update the documentation if necessary
6. Issue the pull request
