/**
 * Stop: do not finish a session that edited UI and measured none of it.
 *
 * This is the rule "never state a number you did not measure" turned into
 * something that happens rather than something the model is asked to remember.
 * If the session edited a renderable page and there is no live, passing receipt
 * for it - no receipt at all, one whose hash no longer matches because the page
 * was edited after it was measured, or only receipts from a gate that failed or
 * skipped - say so and block.
 *
 * Deliberate softenings:
 *   - stop_hook_active always lets the turn end. It is true when Claude Code is
 *     already continuing because of a Stop hook, and blocking again there never
 *     ends. The state is still computed first so the observability log records
 *     whether the agent finished with pages unmeasured.
 *   - Only pages (.html/.htm) are required. A stylesheet or a component source
 *     cannot be rendered by itself: verify_states on a .css file checks zero
 *     elements and passes, so demanding a receipt for one adds friction and
 *     measures nothing.
 *   - With no browser on the machine the render gates cannot run at all, so
 *     blocking would be a demand nobody can satisfy. It downgrades to requiring
 *     the answer to say the work is unmeasured.
 *
 * And one rule it must never break: the command it prints has to be one that
 * clears it. Version 2.9.8 printed a command whose receipts landed where the
 * hook never looked, and blocked every turn for the rest of the session (#24).
